🏠 Real Estate Workflow Automation: Lead Intelligence & Centralization
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a production-ready automation built on Make.com for a real estate firm. It eliminates manual data entry by synchronizing property sourcing information from front-line agents into a centralized cloud database, while providing instant team notifications and AI-driven optimization suggestions.

1. The Business Challenge
Real estate agents often spend 30% of their time on administrative tasks. In this specific case, the client faced:

Data Silos: Property leads were scattered across paper notes, messaging apps, and personal spreadsheets.

Inconsistency: Manual entry led to missing data fields and formatting errors.

Delayed Action: The time between "finding a property" and "manager review" was 24-48 hours, causing them to miss high-value opportunities.

2. The Solution: Automated Lead Pipeline
I designed an end-to-end automated workflow that acts as the "Digital Nervous System" for the firm:

Workflow Logic:
Capture (Trigger): Agents submit property details via a mobile-friendly Google Form or Typeform while on-site.

Process (Make.com): * Data is validated and standardized (e.g., currency and area units).

AI Enrichment: A Gemini API module analyzes the "Description" field to auto-categorize the property type and sentiment.

Storage (Action): Instant synchronization to a Google Sheets/Excel master database.

Notification: An immediate summary is sent to the management Slack/Line channel for instant review.

3. Technical Architecture
Orchestration: Make.com

Frontend: Google Forms / Typeform

Backend: Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets API

Intelligence: Google Gemini API (Natural Language Processing)

Communication: Slack / Line Notify

4. Business Impact (ROI)
Admin Time Saved: Reduced manual data entry time by 95%.

Data Accuracy: Achieved 100% consistency in lead formatting.

Lead Response Time: Improved from 24 hours to < 5 minutes, allowing the firm to bid on competitive properties faster.

5. Optimization Roadmap (Consultant’s Vision)
As an AI Solution Consultant, I proposed the following enhancements to further scale the client's business:

Predictive Lead Scoring: Implement a machine learning model to rank properties based on historical ROI.

Automated Contract Generation: Use the centralized data to auto-fill PDF contract templates via DocuSign or PDF.co.

Market Trend Analysis: Connect the database to a BI tool (like Looker) to visualize price trends across different districts in real-time.
